This document will analyze some of the gapminder data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")
```

```{r read-in-data, echo=FALSE}
gap.in<-read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
#summary(gap.in)

gap.in %>% 
  select(pop,country,continent,year) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(median = median(pop))
```

```{r plotting-fcn, echo=FALSE}

make_plot <- function(data,selctry) {
  subdata <- filter(data, country == selctry) 
  plot(x = subdata$year, 
       y = subdata$gdp/1e12, 
       main = paste0(selctry,": GDP evolution"), 
       xlab = "Year", 
       ylab = "GDP (T$)", 
       pch = 20, tck = 0.01)
#       cex = 5*(subdata[,3]/max(subdata[,3])))
  axis(4, tick = TRUE, labels = FALSE, tck = 0.01)
  axis(3, tick = TRUE, labels = FALSE, tck = 0.01)
#  dev.off()
}

gap.in %>% 
  select(country,year,pop,gdpPercap) %>%
  filter(country == "Canada"| country == "Mexico"| country == "Chile") %>%
  group_by(country) -> ctrydata
ctrydata<-mutate(ctrydata,gdp=pop*gdpPercap)

#ctrydataCA<-filter(ctrydata, country == "Canada") 

```

## Plots of GDP versus time

Notably, Mexico has a larger GDP than Canada, and Chile's GDP was badly hurt by the Pinochet years.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
make_plot(ctrydata,"Canada")  
make_plot(ctrydata,"Mexico")  
make_plot(ctrydata,"Chile")  
```

## Life Expectancies

```{r life-expectancies, echo=FALSE}
# min mean max for each continent

gap.in %>% 
  select(lifeExp,country,continent,year) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(minPop = min(lifeExp), meanPop = mean(lifeExp), maxPop = max(lifeExp))

```

African life expectancies are the shortest in the world, for the simple analysis performed here. Africa has the shortest life expectancy (by continent), the shortest mean, and the lowest maximum. In Europe there is a very small range of life expectancies, and in Oceania the range is even smaller. 


```{r life-expectancies-plot, echo=FALSE}
gap.in %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) -> lastdata
hist(lastdata$lifeExp,
     xlab = "Years",
     ylab = "Number of Countries",
     main = "Life Expectancy Distribution")

hist(lastdata$lifeExp, breaks = c(35:85),
     xlab = "Years",
     ylab = "Number of Countries",
     main = "Life Expectancy Distribution")

```

The histogram shows that there seem to be two groups of life expectancy - a narrow group at the high end and a wide tail of low expectancy.
