This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")
```

```{r read-in-data}
gap.in<-read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
summary(gap.in)

gap.in %>% 
  select(pop,country,continent,year) %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(median = median(pop))

```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
